# The supported platforms we can build, passed to `python setup.py bdist_wheel --plat-name ...`

# For macosx, the version number indicates the _minimum_ version, so we just use an arbitrarily old one
# (the same one that numpy uses *shrug*)
# https://docs.python.org/3/distutils/apiref.html#distutils.util.get_platform

# There doesn't seem to be a good list of platforms. The best I can find is the source code of distutils:
# https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/master/Lib/distutils/util.py
# Inside the packaging system, it then converts "-" to "_" to produce the platform name that goes in the filename

## Install

## Contributing

## Release

This will release both the CLI and Python package:

```
make release VERSION=<version>
```

It pushes a new tag, which will trigger the "Release" Github action.

## Project structure

## VSCode development environment

If you use VSCode, we've included a workspace that will set up everything with the correct settings (formatting, autocomplete, and so on). Open it by running:

    code replicate.code-workspace

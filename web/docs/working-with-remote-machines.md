Replicate makes it really easy to work with multiple training machines.

## Storing data on S3 or Google Cloud Storage

You can push experiments to a central registry. This means that your experiments are not tied to the machine they are run on. It also allows you to share experiments with collagues.

## Running training jobs on remote machines

## What's next

You might want to take a look at the [`replicate.yaml` reference](replicate-yaml.md), or take a look at some of our [example models](example-models).

If something doesn't make sense, doesn't work, or you just have some questions, please email us: [team@replicate.ai](mailto:team@replicate.ai). We love hearing from you!

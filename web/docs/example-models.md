The best way to learn is by example, so here are some examples of models using Replicate:

- [replicate-getting-started](https://github.com/replicate/replicate-getting-started) – The model used in the [getting started guide](getting-started.md)
- [movie-recommendations](https://github.com/replicate/movie-recommendations) – A model that recommends movies.

If you haven't got access to any of any of these repositories, email us at [team@replicate.ai](mailto:team@replicate.ai).

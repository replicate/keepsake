The best way to learn is by example, so here are some examples of models using Replicate:

- [iris-classifier](https://github.com/replicate/iris-classifier) – The model used in [the tutorial](tutorial.md)
- _more soon!_

<!-- - [movie-recommendations](https://github.com/replicate/movie-recommendations) – A model that recommends movies. -->

If you haven't got access to any of any of these repositories, email us at [team@replicate.ai](mailto:team@replicate.ai).

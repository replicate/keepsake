            Everyone uses version control for software, but it’s much less
            common in machine learning.
          </p>
          <p>
            This causes all sorts of problems: people are manually keeping track
            of things in spreadsheets, model weights are scattered on S3, and
            results can’t be reproduced. Somebody who wrote a model has left the
            team? Bad luck – nothing’s written down and you’ve probably got to
            start from scratch.
          </p>
          <p>
            So why isn’t everyone using Git?{" "}
            <strong>Git doesn’t work well with machine learning.</strong> It
            can’t handle large files, it can’t handle key/value metadata like
            metrics, and it can’t record information automatically from inside a
            training script. There are some solutions for these things, but they
            feel like band-aids.
          </p>
          <p>
            We spent a year talking to people in the ML community about this,
            and this is what we found out:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>We need a native version control system for ML.</strong>{" "}
              It’s sufficiently different to normal software that we can’t just
              put band-aids on existing systems.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>
                It needs to be small, easy to use, and extensible.
              </strong>{" "}
              We found people struggling to migrate to “AI Platforms”. We
              believe tools should do one thing well and combine with other
              tools to produce the system you need.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>It needs to be open source.</strong> There are a number of
              proprietary solutions, but something so foundational needs to be
              built by and for the ML community.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            We need your help to make this a reality. If you’ve built this for
            yourself, or are just interested in this problem, join us to help
            build a better system for everyone.

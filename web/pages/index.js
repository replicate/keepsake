            <p>
              On every training run, Replicate automatically saves
              hyperparameters, code, training data, weights, metrics, Python
              version, Python dependencies — <em>everything</em>.

            </h2>
            <p>
              You can get back the code and weights from any checkpoint if you
              need to figure out how a model was trained or commit to Git after
              the fact.

            <p>
              All the model weights are versioned and stored on your own Amazon
              S3 or Google Cloud bucket, so it's really easy to feed them into
              production systems.

            Just add two lines of code and Replicate will start keeping track of

            There's no need to carefully commit everything to Git. Replicate
            lets you get back to any point you called{" "}
            <code>experiment.checkpoint()</code>, so you can commit to Git once
            you've found something that works.

            experiment inside Docker. All the results are stored on S3 so you
            can access them from your laptop.

The `replicate.yaml` file tells Replicate how to train your model and where to store it. This page is a comprehensive reference for it. To get an introduction on how to write it, see [working with remote machines](/docs/tutorial/remote-machines).

<!-- `replicate.yaml` goes in the same directory as your model's source code. It must be in the root directory (the same directory as the root of your Git repository, for example) because Replicate uses the location of the file to figure out where your model is located. (maybe this lives in tutorial) -->

It looks a bit like this:

```yaml
storage: "s3://hooli-hotdog-model"
python: "3.8"
```

## `cuda`

The CUDA version to install when you use `replicate run`.

By default, Replicate will attempt to pick a CUDA version based on the Tensorflow or PyTorch versions you choose. This option lets you set the version if you aren't using Tensorflow or PyTorch, or want to override it for whatever reason.

For example:

```yaml
cuda: "10.2"
```

## `install`

A list of commands to run to set up the Docker environment that `replicate run` runs inside. For example:

```yaml
install:
  - "apt-get update -qq && apt-get install -yq cowsay"
```

## `install_script`

The path to a script that sets up the Docker environment for `replicate run`. You can use this if you need to do something more complicated than you can do with the `install` option.

For example, say you have this script, called `install.sh`:

```bash
#!/bin/bash -e
apt-get update -qq
apt-get install -yq cowsay
```

You would include this line in `replicate.yaml` to run this script to set up the Docker environment for `replicate run`:

```yaml
install_script: "./install.sh"
```

## `python`

The Python version to use for `repicate run`, omitting the patch version \(i.e. `3.8`, not `3.8.1`\). It can take one of these values:

- `2.7`
- `3.5`
- `3.6`
- `3.7`
- `3.8`

For example:

```yaml
python: "3.8"
```

## `python_requirements`

The path to a file which contains Python requirements to be installed in the environment for `replicate run`, in the format used by pip. By default, this is `requirements.txt`.

You might want to use this if you need to define some different requirements for your Replicate environment. For example:

```yaml
python_requirements: "requirements-replicate.txt"
```

<!-- FIXME: this is an anti-pattern... we want people to be using normal requirements.txt, really... -->

## `storage`

The location where Replicate will store your project data (experiments, checkpoints, etc).

By default, data is stored in `.replicate/storage/` on disk relative to the location of `replicate.yaml`.

It supports several different storage mechanisms:

- **Local disk**: If you pass a path, it is assumed to be a path on disk, relative to the location of `replicate.yaml`. For example:

  ```yaml
  storage: "/mnt/storage/"
  ```

- **Amazon S3**: If you use the form `s3://bucket-name`, it will store the data on S3. For example:

  ```yaml
  storage: "s3://hooli-hotdog-detector"
  ```

  You must [install the AWS CLI](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-install.html) and run `aws configure` to authenticate with your Amazon account before using this method.

- **Google Cloud Storage**: If you use the form `gs://bucket-name`, it will store the data on Google Cloud Storage. For example:

  ```yaml
  storage: "gs://hooli-hotdog-detector"
  ```

  You must install the [Cloud SDK](https://cloud.google.com/sdk) and run `gcloud auth login` before using this method.

For Amazon S3 and Google Cloud Storage, you can also define a root directory inside the bucket so you can store multiple models per bucket. For example, `s3://hooli-models/hotdog-detector`. We recommend against this unless you have a good reason to â€“ having a bucket per project allows for fine-grained access control.

<DocsLayout title="Load models for inference">


Keepsake versions all of the models you train and stores them on Amazon S3 or Google Cloud Storage, so you can pull down those models into inference systems.

# Load models within Python

Using the Keepsake Python API, you can load a model directly from within your inference script. For example, if you did this in your training script:

```python
import torch
import keepsake
def train():
    experiment = keepsake.init(path=".", params={...})

    for epoch in range(num_epochs):
        # ...

        torch.save(model, "model.pth")
        experiment.checkpoint(
            path="model.pth",
            metrics={"loss": loss},
            primary_metric=("loss", "minimize")
        )
```

Then you can use this in your inference script to get the model back:

```python
import keepsake
experiment = keepsake.experiments.get("e510303")
checkpoint = experiment.best()

model = torch.load(checkpoint.open("model.pth"))
```

  This also works inside notebooks
</a> if you want to do visualization of your model's output.

# Load models from the CLI

You can also get files using the command-line interface. This might be useful if you want the model weights on disk, or if you're building a Docker image with the weights inside.

For example, if you run this for the example training script above:

```
keepsake checkout e510303 -o weights/
```

Then the model weights will be written to `weights/model.pth`.

<Note>


**Note:** Either an experiment ID or checkpoint ID can be passed to `keepsake checkout`. The checkpoint ID makes a better versioning identifier because it specifies a specific version of your model weights.

You can only use an experiment ID in the Python API, currently. Support for checkpoint IDs is being worked on. [See this GitHub issue for more details.](https://github.com/replicate/keepsake/issues/360)

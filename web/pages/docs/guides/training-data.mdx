<DocsLayout title="Version training data">


A machine learning model is the combination of the code and the training data, so knowing what data you trained a model with is essential.

There are two ways to do this:

1. **Store training data in Replicate.** This is recommended if your training data is small (<100MB).
2. **Point at data in another system.** This is recommended if your training data is large or you already have somewhere to store it.

## Store training data in Replicate

If your training data is small, then we recommend storing it with Replicate in each experiment.

For example, if your training data is in a directory `training-data/` alongside your training code, then you might write this in your code:

```python
experiment = replicate.init(
    path="training-data/",
    params={...}
)
```

If you want to store both your training script and training data, you can just save everything:

```python
experiment = replicate.init(
    path=".",
    params={...}
)
```

Then, to copy this data back to the current directory, you use `replicate checkout`:

```
$ replicate checkout <experiment ID>
```

The downside of this approach is that Replicate makes a complete copy of your training data on each experiment. So, **this approach only works if your training data is small**.

How small is "small" depends on your storage costs and bandwidth, but typically we'd recommend doing this if your data is less than 100MB.

## Point at data in another system

If your training data is large, or you already have a system for storing your training data, then we recommend putting a pointer to your training data in the `params` dictionary.

For example, if your training data is on S3, you might put the URL to your training data in `params`:

```python
training_data_url = "s3://hooli-training-data/hotdogs-2020-05-03.tar.gz"
experiment = replicate.init(
    path=".",
    params={
        "training_data_url": training_data_url
    }
)
# ... download training_data_url and run training
```

This assumes you are disciplined about versioning your data and the contents of that URL never change. If the data at this URL might change, then you might want to [calculate the shasum](https://gist.github.com/rji/b38c7238128edf53a181) and record this in `params`.

Then, if the data changes, you will see a different shasum in `replicate diff`, and you will know an experiment was trained on different data.

**Note:** This documentation is incomplete. We'd love to hear about ways that you are versioning data. See [this GitHub issue](https://github.com/replicate/replicate/issues/359) or [chat to us in Discord](https://discord.gg/QmzJApGjyE).

## First steps

If you prefer **training scripts and the CLI**, [follow the our tutorial to learn how Replicate works](/docs/tutorial).

If you prefer **working in notebooks**, <a href={process.env.TUTORIAL_COLAB_URL} target="_blank">follow our notebook tutorial on Colab</a>.

If you like to **learn concepts first**, [read our guide about how Replicate works](/docs/learn/how-it-works).

## Install

Replicate is a Python package. Run this to install it:

```
pip install -U replicate
```

That's it! This has installed both the [Python library](/docs/reference/python) and the [command-line interface](/docs/reference/cli).

Next, you might want to:

- [Build a model to learn how to use Replicate](/docs/tutorial)
- [Read our guide about how Replicate works](/docs/learn/how-it-works)
- [Read the reference for the Python library](/docs/reference/python)

<!-- FIXME: add this back at some point

## Install with `requirements.txt`

We recommend using `requirements.txt`, so other people who use your code will get Replicate installed automatically. Add this to your `requirements.txt` file, or create a new one:

<CodeBlock className="txt">
  {`replicate==` +
    process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_VERSION +
    `
`}
</CodeBlock>

Then, run this to install it in your Python environment:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

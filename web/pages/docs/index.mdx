## Install

Keepsake is a Python package. Run this to install it:

```
pip install -U keepsake
```

That's it! This has installed both the [Python library](/docs/reference/python) and the [command-line interface](/docs/reference/cli).

## First steps

If you prefer **training scripts and the CLI**, [follow our 10 minute tutorial to get started](/docs/tutorial).

If you prefer **working in notebooks**, <a href={process.env.TUTORIAL_COLAB_URL} target="_blank">follow our notebook tutorial on Colab</a>.

If you like to **learn concepts first**, [read our guide about how Keepsake works](/docs/learn/how-it-works).

## First steps

If you like to **learn by doing**, [our tutorial will help you learn how Replicate works by building a simple model](/docs/tutorial).

If you prefer to **learn concepts first**, take a look at [our guide about how Replicate works](/docs/learn/how-it-works).

## Install

Install Replicate by adding it to your `requirements.txt` file:

<CodeBlock className="txt">
  {`replicate==` +
    process.env.NEXT_PUBLIC_VERSION +
    `
`}
</CodeBlock>

Then, run this to install it in your Python environment:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

It's a good idea to put it in a file and commit it to Git so other people who use your code will have it installed automatically.

If you're just using it for yourself, you can also use pip directly:

```
pip install -U replicate
```

That's it! This has installed both the [Python library](/docs/reference/python) and the [command-line interface](/docs/reference/cli).

Next, you might want to:

- [Build a model to learn how to use Replicate](/docs/tutorial)
- [Read our guide about how Replicate works](/docs/learn/how-it-works)
- [Read the reference for the Python library](/docs/reference/python)
